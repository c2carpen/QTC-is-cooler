    <h2>Who is Quinn</h2>
    <p>A total cutie that popped out and into our lives on October 6th 2019, weighing 8lbs 2oz, 22inches long. Her
        <a href="https://i.etsystatic.com/5560330/c/2014/1600/448/253/il/c051c4/1641877466/il_340x270.1641877466_k048.jpg"> full head of hair</a> and cute blue eyes (for now) are some key features. She's growing all the time and keeping things
        real. Quinn is a great sleeper, having to be woken up during the night to eat. Some of her skills include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Smiling a lot</li>
        <li>staring at faces</li>
        <li>cooing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>She's been working on tummy time and lifting her head. We're so glad she's here and can't wait to see her grow up.</p>
